## Folders:

- ##Rextinct: contains the R package <em>Rextinct</em> (with three user-friendly functions) designed  for computing CRIWM (error-distribution free), and its sister method GRIWM (normal dating errors), and for calibrating 14C dates, respectively. The package accepts observations (fossils, sightings) dated by any combination of other chronometric methods. For 14C chronologies, Rextinct handles fossil dates from the Northern and Southern Hemispheres and marine environments as they require specific 14C calibrations. 

- Sensitivity: contains the R
