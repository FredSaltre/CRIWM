#########CRIWM AND GRIWM EXAMPLES
####DATASET = simulate time series of 50 dated observations (1 to 40 and 43 = non-calibrated  radiocarbon dates, remaining = non-radiocarbon or calibrated dates)
#dates sampled randomly from 1000 to 10000 years Before Present
dates <- sample(c(1000:10000), size = 50)
#errors (1SD) sampled randomly from 10 to 150 years
errors <- sample(c(10:150), size = 50)
#create object with time series of dates (column 1) and errors (column 2) without row and column names
TimeSeries <- data.frame(dates, errors)
#save time series to working directory
write.table(TimeSeries, file = "TimeSeries.txt", row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
getwd()
#########CALIBRATION EXAMPLES
#### DATASET = create unique coding identifiers for each observation and assume all 50 observations are non-calibrated radiocarbon dates
ids <- paste("date", c(1:50), sep = "")
# column 1 = dates, column 2 = errors, column 3 = ids
TimeSeries_cal1 <- data.frame(dates, errors, ids)
#save radiocarbon dates to working directory
write.table(TimeSeries_cal1, file = "TimeSeries_cal1.txt", row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
#calibrate with IntCal20 and 1SD calibration errors (default) and save intercepts (weighted average, median, mode) to working directory (default)
calendar(chrono_data = "TimeSeries_cal.txt")
#calibrate with SHCal20 (Southern Hemisphere samples), compute 2SD calibration errors (default) and cancel output saving
calendar(chrono_data = "TimeSeries_cal1.txt", cal_curve = "shcal20", cal_ci = "sd2", cal_save = "none")
#### DATASET = dates 1 to 20 and 31-50 from Northern Hemisphere, and 21 to 20 from Southern Hemisphere
calib_curves <- c(rep("intcal20", 20), rep("shcal20", 10), rep("shcal20", 20))
# column 1 = dates, column 2 = errors, column 3 = ids, column 4 = calibration curves
TimeSeries_cal2 <- data.frame(dates, errors, ids, calib_curves)
#save radiocarbon dates to working directory
write.table(TimeSeries_cal2, file = "TimeSeries_cal2.txt", row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
#calibrate samples, and save full outputs (PDF moments, multimodality, intercepts)
calendar(chrono_data = "TimeSeries_cal2.txt", cal_curve = "shcal20", cal_save = "full")
dates <- sample(c(1000:10000), size = 50)
errors <- sample(c(10:150), size = 50)
TimeSeries <- data.frame(dates, errors)
write.table(TimeSeries, file = "TimeSeriesG.txt", row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
